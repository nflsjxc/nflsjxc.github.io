## Reflexive forwarding in Named Data Networking
 Reflexive Forwarding is a proposed extension to the CCNx and NDN protocol architectures that eliminates the problems inherent in using independent Interest-Data exchanges for such applications.  
This ia a research project instructed by Professor Dirk Kutscher at HKUST(GZ).

## Computron
Computron is a system that uses memory swapping to serve multiple distributed models on a shared GPU cluster. Computron implements a model parallel swapping design that takes advantage of the aggregate CPU-GPU link bandwidth of a cluster to speed up model parameter transfers. 
This is a course project for CS267 Application of Parallel Computers at UC Berkeley
